# Java Interview Playground 🧠 ☕️

Welcome to my personal playground for mastering Java coding interviews using **TDD**, **clean code**, and **data structures**.

This repository documents my hands-on practice through:
- 🔁 Test-Driven Development (TDD) loops
- 🧱 Core data structures (Stack, Map, LinkedList, etc.)
- 🧪 Structured unit testing with JUnit 5
- 📚 Problem solving from LeetCode's Top Interview Questions (Medium)

## 🧠 What you'll find here

- ✅ Solved problems with clear naming and test structure
- 💡 Documented pseudocode-to-implementation process
- 🧪 Tests grouped by type: edge cases, valid, invalid
- 🧾 Clean and refactorable Java code
- 🎓 Mentorship-style comments embedded in key sections

## 📁 Structure

Each problem lives in its own package under `src/main/java/com/luisovando/interview`.

Each has:
- a main class with a clean implementation
- a test class grouped and commented for clarity

## 🚀 Getting started

To run tests:

```bash
./gradlew test       # or mvn test if you use Maven
